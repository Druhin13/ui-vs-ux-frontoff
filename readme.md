# Frontloops Challenge

[Frontloops] is a front-end challenge site by Dimitry Belyaev, a Sr. FE Dev at Booking.com. As part of the challenge you get an image/video file of the final design then off you code.

I've decided to hone my FE skills a bit whilst also **practicing some UX Design by also tweaking the designs** if and when needed.

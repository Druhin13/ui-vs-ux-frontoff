# Frontloops Challenge

[Frontloops] is a front-end challenge site by Dimitry Belyaev, a Sr. FE Dev at Booking.com. As part of the challenge you get an image/video file of the final design then off you code.

I've decided to hone my FE skills a bit whilst also **practicing some UX Design by also tweaking the designs** if and when needed.

## Markup
To improve HTML and CSS skills.

### Day 1 - Plan Picker

The original design:

My design:

#### UX redesign

- added an h1 to explain the selection
- slightly larger text (suggested base font-size was 14px ðŸ”¬ which is waaaay too tiny)
- more contrasting font colour for the description
